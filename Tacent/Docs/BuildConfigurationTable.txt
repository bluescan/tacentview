What's on and off in the various build configurations. Some of this is just planned.

Configuration:		Debug		Develop		Profile		Release		Ship
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiler Opt		no			yes			yes			yes			yes

Debug Symbols		yes			yes			no			no			no

Asserts				yes			yes			no			yes			no

Debug Draw			yes			yes			no			no			no		(includes screen print and debug primitives)

Live Tuning			yes			yes			no			yes			no

Printf				yes			yes			no			yes			no		(print to string always available)

Debug Camera		yes			yes			yes			yes			no

World Editor		yes			yes			no			no			no

Profiling			no			no			yes			no			no

After Profiling, think of Release as a step before Ship. You can still detect critical asserts, but it should run at near ship speeds. Gathering of marketing materials and screenshots should be done in release.

Configuration defines follow the naming:
CONFIG_DEBUG
CONFIG_DEVELOP
CONFIG_PROFILE
CONFIG_RELEASE
CONFIG_SHIP

Platform defines follow the naming:
PLATFORM_WINDOWS
PLATFORM_LINUX
PLATFORM_ANDROID
PLATFORM_IOS

Architecture defines follow the naming:
ARCHITECTURE_X86	(Also know as IA-32, i386, x86-32)
ARCHITECTUTE_X64	(Also know as AMD64, x86-64. NOT IA-64 though, that's for Itanium only)

BUILD_TOOL
This is defined for all tools. It can be useful for some modules that are compiled for use by both buildtime tools and the runtime.

Pipeline messages (i.e. any stdout prints from any tool) should be prefixed with the following:

Info: An 'info' message is just that, nothing is wrong. Just telling the user something. These messages may omit the 'Info:' first.
Notice: A notice is a 'light' warning. Not a big deal sort of thing. Build continues.
Warning: A warning is something that should be fixed, but the pipeline will continue anyways.
Error: Catastrophic failure. Input must be fixed. Pipeline fails.
