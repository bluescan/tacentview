If PVRFMT == TACFMT the filename will be just FMT_TYPE_SPC_CHANS_FLAGS.pvr

Flags:
T = Regular 2D texture.
V = Volume 3D texture.
C = Cubemap. Has up to 6 2D textures.

A = Texture array. Has an arbitrary number of textures.
M = Has Mipmaps.
P = Premultiplied Alpha

Note that for PVRFMT we go with what is shown in PVRTexTool, not what the spec shows as it can be incorrect. For example, R8 G8 B8 A8 in the UI is encoded as pixel format 0x12 which is, according to Imagination's own PVR12 spec, ARGB 8888. In fact it IS R8G8B8A8 just like the UI shows.
